# Missing Data Imputation
A Workshop at Insight NYC on Missing Data

I've included slides and a jupyter notebook walking the user through some techniques in Python to impute missing data. The slides provide an introduction to the techniques while MissingData.ipynb walks the user through some common implementations of imputation using the nba dataset.

After reading through the slides I would encourage individuals to try the imputation techniques out using the nhl data set with the goal of predicting the salaries of nhl players.
